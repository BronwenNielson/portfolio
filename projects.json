The objective for the project was to build a website with at least 3 seperate pages, for organisation, buisness or event, using HTML and CSS and hosted via Github Pages. This site is fully functional and responsive, with interactive visual elements throughout the site. I also chose to create a contact form using PHP, this however is not currently functional as it does not have an end point. This site can be accessed at https://bronwennielson.github.io/hogwarts/index.html",

This was an interesting exercise as it taught me a lot about Javascript's built in Date function, including that it is not the most accurate tool, as the date it returns is always a few days off from correct",
